				<p>Bill Monreal is an international technology assessment, deployment & management expert who brings 20 years of IT experience to the industry. He attended The University of Akron before beginning his career as an engineer. After reaching the level of Senior Engineer, Bill launched out on his own as an independent contractor to build his vision of an IT company built on his own foundation of the core principles of hard work, enthusiasm, innovative solutions, adaptability, teamwork, and excellence.</p>
		
				<p>Bill founded Monreal Consulting in 1999. The company focused on Systems and Infrastructure Design with partners like Cisco, Juniper, Enterasys, Dell, HP, Microsoft, and Red Hat, landing several long term contracts, and began to bring on employees in early 2001.</p>
				
				<p>After steady growth through 2007, the economic downturn of 2008 caused a massive reduction in available business. Monreal weathered this storm and emerged stronger.  2010 brought massive expansion in opportunities with the awarding of Monreal's first international contract. In the years since, Monreal has experienced record growth and double digit increases in revenue year after year.</p>
				
				<p>Today Monreal manages single or multifaceted technology projects that enable strategic business objectives; managing complex, multi-vendor, culturally diverse environments while driving results to project completion. A multi-year winner of the Fast Track 50 Award, Monreal consults Fortune 500 customers as a global consulting company strategically guiding organizations toward improvement of their business and achievement of their objectives through cost-effective planning and execution.</p>
